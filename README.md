# SuperZekes's PvP Pack

This modpack is perfect for PvPers. Mods such as small totem pops are great so you can see more when you're in battle! Also another good one is world host so you can host worlds to battle your friends, on top of that some QoL features as well. It includes ViaFabricPlus. If your looking to play a server for an older version then simply change the version using the button, then join it and boom! This modpack works with all versions! look at some more <a href="https://modrinth.com/modpack/superzekes-pvp/gallery">here</a>. I made this pack because of my love to PvP. I hope the mods in here help you while in battle!

## Looking for a place to pvp?
I would recommend <a href="https://pvplegacy.net/">PvP Legacy</a> if you want the best 1.9 pvp experience.

I would highly recommend <a href="https://hypixel.net/">Hypixel</a> if your looking for a 1.8 pvp server

## Theres a version I want thats not there
As said above viafabricplus lets you join servers from any version.
If theres a version you really really want for whatever reason fork the repo on GitHub and make it yourself!
